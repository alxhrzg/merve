# MLServer FastAPI Wrapper - Project Evolution History


## General Story-line
* The initial commit is based on a previous project as running at my previous company - insparx.
* The project bootstraps from an existing code-base for containerising and managing ML applications.
* The previous project only managed one classifier per repository - did not run with FastAPI but with Seldon-core (outdated by now)
* Also we didn't have any suppot tools to manage, build and push repositories
* This is a substantial but necessary evolution to support our current use-case of supporting, managing the lifecycle of multiple classifiers per ML project repository
* Additionally, this is the first time that we actually have and support and extensive test-suit. Something which did not exist previously.
* This was possible by aided refactoring with claude code, also all tests of now are generated by claude-code.

#### Phase 17: Complex Response Format Support (Current Session)
**Uncommitted changes - Today's major enhancement**

##### Step 1: Problem Identification
- Discovered bug where complex dictionary responses were incorrectly handled
- Example: `{"a": [1,2,3], "b": {"c": [1,2,3]}}` returned as just `['a', 'b']`
- Identified need for flexible response formats

##### Step 2: Root Cause Analysis
- Found `_to_jsonable` function only handled numpy scalars
- Response model (`PredictResponse`) was too rigid
- No support for arbitrary JSON structures

##### Step 3: Enhanced JSON Serialization
- **Rewrote `_to_jsonable` function**:
  - Recursive dictionary handling
  - Numpy array conversion
  - Pandas DataFrame support
  - Nested structure preservation

##### Step 4: Response Format Configuration
- **Added three response formats**:
  1. **`standard`** - Traditional format (backward compatible)
  2. **`custom`** - Flexible format with `result` field
  3. **`passthrough`** - Raw predictor output

- **Configuration options**:
  ```yaml
  api:
    response_format: "custom"
    response_validation: true
    extract_values: false
  ```

##### Step 5: Schema Updates
- Created `CustomPredictResponse` schema
- Added `SinglePredictRequest` for clarity
- Enhanced response validation options

##### Step 6: Dynamic Endpoint Registration
- Made response model dynamic based on configuration
- Endpoint registration adapts to response format
- Maintained backward compatibility

##### Step 7: Comprehensive Testing
- Created unit tests for complex response handling
- Integration tests for all response formats
- Example predictors demonstrating features
- Live server testing with verification

##### Step 8: Documentation Updates
- Created `docs/api-standardization.md`
- Updated `docs/configuration.md`
- Added response format examples
- Created implementation plan

##### Step 9: Complete Configuration Documentation
- **Created fully annotated `mlserver.yaml` example**:
  - ALL available parameters documented
  - Default values shown
  - Detailed inline annotations
  - Section organization

- **Verified against implementation**:
  - Validated all parameters
  - Tested with live server
  - Created reference example
